I am a PhD researcher in Machine Learning at Imperial College London supervised by [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk/).
I am currently also a visiting student at the University of Oxford. Previously, I worked as a research scientist at Babylon Health.

Research
======
I am generally interested in researching useful inductive biases for building robust systems.
I believe Causality and Bayesian ideas to be key for this. Currently, I have been working on developing
flexible approaches to causal discovery using Bayesian model selection, with the aim of applying
causal discovery to real world problems.
I also hope to use insights from this in improving robustness and generalistion of machine learning systems.
Feel free to reach out if any of these topics interest you.

A non-exhaustive list of topics I am interested in:
- Causality: causal discovery, effect estimation, representation learning
- Model selection: Bayesian model selection, MDL
- Bayesian methods: Bayesian deep learning, Gaussian processes, probabilistic models, inference methods
- Deep learning: Local learning rules, generalisation
- Information theory: Kolmogorov complexity, information bottleneck
