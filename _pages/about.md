I am a PhD researcher in Machine Learning at Imperial College London supervised by [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk/). Previously, worked as a research scientist at Babylon Health.

Research
======
My research interests mainly lie in causality, Bayesian machine learning and deep learning.

I'm particularly excited about using principles from Bayesian model selection to make discovering causal relations more flexible.
Early work on this was accepted at Neurips 2022 "Causal ML for Impact" workshop.
This could guide methods for areas such as causal representation learning where flexibility in learning represenatations is particularly important.
Of course, this will require good estimates for Marginal Likelihoods in deep models, which is another area of research I am excited about.
